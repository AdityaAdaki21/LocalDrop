## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Download and Run (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `LocalDrop.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/AdityaAdaki21/LocalDrop/releases) page

2. When you try to run the executable, you may see a Windows Security warning:
   - "Windows protected your PC" message will appear
   - This is normal for unsigned executables
   - To run anyway:
     1. Click "More info"
     2. Click "Run anyway"
     > Note: This warning appears because the app isn't signed with a Microsoft certificate. The source code is open and available for review.

3. Using the Executable:
   - **Standalone Use**: 
     - Place `LocalDrop.exe` in any folder you want to share
     - Double-click to run - it will share the folder it's placed in
   
   - **Creating a Shortcut** (Recommended):
     - Right-click `LocalDrop.exe` ‚Üí Create Shortcut
     - Move the shortcut to your desktop/preferred location
     - Right-click shortcut ‚Üí Properties
     - Set "Start in" to your preferred share folder
     - Now you can run LocalDrop from anywhere while sharing your chosen folder

4. When you run LocalDrop:
   - A console window will open showing the server status
   - Your default browser will automatically open
   - Other devices can connect using the displayed network URL
   - The shared folder will be the one containing the exe (or specified in shortcut)

### Security Notes üîí

1. **Windows SmartScreen Warning**:
   - This warning appears because the executable isn't digitally signed
   - The application is open-source, and you can:
     - Review the source code
     - Build it yourself from source
     - Run from source code directly

2. **Safe Usage**:
   - Only run LocalDrop on trusted networks (like your home network)
   - Anyone on your network can access the shared folder
   - Close the console window to stop sharing
   - The application only shares the folder it's placed in (or specified in shortcut)
